ivy-housekeep.sh
----------------

Currently takes two parameters:

1. Folder where the artefact are, e.g. /home/james/mnt/framework2/ivyrep/corelogic/trunk/corelogic-interfaceserver
2. How many revisions to keep, e.g. 3

Example call:

./ivy-housekeep.sh /home/james/mnt/framework2/ivyrep/corelogic/trunk/corelogic-interfaceserver 3

ivy-batch.sh
------------

Until I've written a wrapper script, this just calls the houskeeping script on a number of known directories.
