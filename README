SHELL-FU
--------

This repository contains random shell scripts I've written for automating various tasks.

It's split into directories with scripts roughly grouped by purpose.

-build-tools		Scripts written to help with frameworki build tasks
-classic-book		Exercises from the Classic Shell Scripting book
-git-svn-helpers	Migrating our SVN repository to Git
-ivy-housekeep		Keeping the Ivy repository tidy
-networking		Random stuff to do with networking, VPN etc

Each directory has its own README with a description of each script.
